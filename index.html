                    <p class="lead"> Thank you for taking the time to check me out, my name is Cole Amodeo and I am a Jr. Freelance Web Developer just starting out on a long journey of a career.I have had a passion for computer sciences and technological design since I was a very young lad. This is my humble beginnings. Although my true passion is video game design. I have been hopelessly intrigued by both the concepts and experiences derived from video games. The general populace has previously had a negative predisposition towards video games.In recent years this stigma has been lifting as the culture of video games pushes forward into a societal norm.</p>
                    <hr class="my-4">
                    <p> I began my adventure at the University of Guelph, in the Bachelor of Commerce Program with a Major in Accounting. After 3 years or so of grinding my courses out, I realized I had no passion or intrinsic motivation pushing me towards my accounting goals. So I took a year off and traveled to Australia where I worked on learning more about myself. Being a nerd at heart I've fallen back on my true passion, technological developments.</p>
